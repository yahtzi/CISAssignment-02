    <p>People couldn't say my name in high school and someone said Yahtzi once and it stuck. So, I've been called that for about eight years now. I like to joke around and say that I get called that because I always get played.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I was born in Phoenix, Arizona but we moved ever year be it from city to city or state to state. California is the place I've stayed the longest.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I have a four legged, furry son named Douglas. He is my entire life and I spoil the life out of him because he deserves the best for being the bestest boy.</p>
